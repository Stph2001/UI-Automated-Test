# UI-Automated-Test

## Libraries and Tools used in this project

This project relies on the following Python libraries and tools:

### WebDriver Chrome
I used this test automation tool to allow me to control and manipulate an instance of Chrome from Python code.

### Selenium
Selenium was used to automate a test case in the respective web browser. It allowed the simulation of various actions, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, navigating between sections, and extracting data from the page.

### Faker
Faker was used to generate fake data for a user from the United States. It provided data to register, such as name, email, and password, as well as data to fill in the shipping address.

### Time
The time library was used to pause the code execution for a few seconds. This ensured that the page loaded properly and allowed the actions to continue without errors.

### Random
Random was primarily used to generate random values throughout the project.

Please make sure to have these libraries and tools installed before running the code. You can do so by running `pip install <library-name>` in your terminal/command prompt.
